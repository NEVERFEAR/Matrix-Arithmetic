This library contains functions for creating and manipulating matrices.

Sample matrix creation:

    M = [
            [ 1, 2,  4],
            [ 1, 3,  9],
            [ 1, 7, 49]
    ]
    
Complex object matrix creation:
    
    MM = Matrix(M)

Reduce a matrix modulo a number:

    Modulo(M, 2)
    # or
    MM.modulo(2)
    # or
    MM % 2

Scale a matrix by a factor:
    
    Scale(M, 3)
    # or
    MM.scale(3)
    # or
    MM * 3
    
Add a factor to every element of a matrix:
    
    Add(M, 1)
    
Negate all terms in a matrix:
    
    Negate(M)
    # or
    Scale(M)
    # or
    MM.scale(-1)
    # or
    MM * -1

Get the identity matrix:
    
    I = Identity(M)
    # or
    MM.identity()
