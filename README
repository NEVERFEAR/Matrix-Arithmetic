This library contains functions for creating and manipulating matrices.

Sample matrix creation:

    M = [
            [ 1, 2,  4],
            [ 1, 3,  9],
            [ 1, 7, 49]
    ]

Reduce a matrix modulo a number:

    Modulo(M, 2)

Scale a matrix by a factor:
    
    Scale(M, 3)
    
Add a factor to every element of a matrix:
    
    Add(M, 1)
    
Negate all terms in a matrix:
    
    Negate(M)

Get the identity matrix:
    
    I = Identity(M)
